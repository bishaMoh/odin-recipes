        Cooked okra in a special tomato stew with tinder lamb pieces.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients :</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2L  premade tabeekh base read the recipe</li>
        <li>500g  fresh okra washed, heads and tails removed</li>
        <li>750 1L  chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tbsp  tomato puree/paste</li>
        <li>2 3  garlic cloves crushed</li>
        <li>2 tbsp  ground coriander</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps :</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the clean, trimmed okra to the tabeekh base ideally halfway through step 6 of the tabeekh base recipe, specifically with 25-35min of cooking time remaining. This is because raw okra takes longer to cook than other vegetables, therefore including it at this stage will ensure the meat and okra finish cooking a the same time. Cover the pot and allow 25-35min for the okra to fully cook.</li>
        <li>Add tomato puree/paste and chopped tomatoes then stir in evenly. Keep covered and on a low heat for a further 10-15mins to allow the tomato to cook. Add ground coriander and season with salt and pepper to taste. Gently mix the sauce.</li>
        <li>Allow 10min for an oily layer to develop on the surface, known in Sudanese cooking as: al wish â€“ the face. Finish by adding crushed garlic as the oils rise and mix in gently. Taste and balance accordingly.</li>

    </ol>
